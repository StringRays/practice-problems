       An empty square which is adjacent to a hedge (including diagonally) will be filled in the next year. 
A square which is filled with a hedge will be empty the following year if it is surrounded on all eight sides by other hedges, which prevents it from getting enough sun. Note that hedges on the edge squares will always get enough sun.
Any other squares will be left intact.
